  <p>This web page provides information about the game of golf. This includes a little about it's origins, main rules
    and other background.
    The game originated in it's current form in Scotland, but the Netherlands claim an earlier version originated in
    their country. We may never know the precise origins.
  </p>
  <p>Golf is typically played on a golf course consisting of either 9 or 18 holes, usually played on grass. Each hole
    begins on the tee and ends on a green, a closely mown area with a hole in the ground. The player moves the ball from
    the tee to the hole on the green using one or more golf clubs. The objective is to get the ball into the hole in as
    few shots as possible, without injuring yourself or other people and without damaging property.</p>
  <p>Some examples of prominent golf courses are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>St Andrews</li>
    <li>Pebble Beach</li>
    <li>Carnoustie</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="https://www.standrews.com/">St Andrews Old Course</a> is probably the most famous golf course.</p>
